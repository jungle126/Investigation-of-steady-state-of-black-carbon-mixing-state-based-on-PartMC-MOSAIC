**Python scripts are saved here. If you need to run, please run the 'saveDcDpconc.py' first, this script helps to save the information of Dc, Dp, and conc of BC aerosols, which are needed for Plot scripts.**

**The plot file 'Figure3_abc.py' need the file './Data/MAC_MACE_Rabs_MACEX_ABC_time', 
which needs to be created by Matlab script './matlab/Eabs_perparticle.m' 
using data in './Data/Dp_Dc_Conc.csv' **
